A small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) is defined as an unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds (25 kg) on takeoff, including everything that is on board or otherwise attached to the aircraft. We will cover who is required to obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate for commercial operations, the roles and responsibilities of the Remote Pilot in Command (PIC), the visual observer, and the person manipulating the controls. You will also learn about the aircraft registration requirements and what constitutes a 'commercial' operation versus a recreational one.",

As a remote pilot, you must be able to identify these classes on an aeronautical chart and know the rules for operating within them. Class G airspace is uncontrolled and generally does not require authorization. Classes B, C, and D are controlled airspaces surrounding busy airports and require prior authorization from Air Traffic Control (ATC) before you can operate. Class E airspace is also controlled but has different rules depending on the altitude and location. This section will teach you how to read charts to identify these zones and obtain the necessary permissions.",

You will learn to decode these reports, understanding terms for wind, visibility, cloud cover (like 'OVC' for overcast), and precipitation.

Understanding temperature inversions, where temperature increases with altitude, is also key, as they can create hazardous wind shear and visibility issues.",
